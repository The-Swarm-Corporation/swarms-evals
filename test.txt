GsM8K-Agent: To calculate Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to determine the final value of the house after the repairs. The increase in value by 150% means the final value is 250% of the original value. 

The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. So, the total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

To determine the final value, we need to find 250% of the original value:
250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, we subtract the total investment from the final value to find the profit:
$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000 from flipping the house.

GsM8K-Agent: To calculate the total meters James runs in a week, we first find out how many meters he runs in a day. 

James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, so in one day, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters. 

Since he runs this 3 times a week, we multiply by 3 to find the total meters run in a week:
180 meters * 3 days = 540 meters in a week.

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters every week.

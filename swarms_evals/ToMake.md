# Metrics

[ ] Task accomplished y/n

[ ] Task quality 1-5

[ ] was a tool used y/n
   [ ] which tool
   [ ] how was it used
   [ ] were tools called in the right order
   [ ] were the tools used correctly? Did the environment change?
   [ ] Did the agent output match the expected reference output?

[ ] Compute load

[ ] Cost $
   " the cost per 1000 function callings ![alt text](image.png)"

[ ] Average Latency (s)
    "Latency: we measure the latency by timing each request to the endpoint ignoring the function document preprocessing time."

[ ] Model size needed (Small, Medium, Large)
[ ] Model type needed (LM, VLM, predictive, point cloud, NeRF/Splat)
[ ] Number of trials to acceptable performance
[ ] Number of trials to best performance
